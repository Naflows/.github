# Welcome to Naflows!


Naflows is a business project rooted in open-source values, focused on secure environments, free access to code, and people-first development. Our mission is to build strong, independent, and reliable infrastructures that can host a wide range of services—always with simplicity, accessibility, and transparency in mind.

Every project we create is designed to serve real needs and make technology more human, open, and empowering.

By sponsoring Naflows, you’re not just funding development—you’re joining the journey. Your support helps us grow, stay independent, and keep building tools that matter.
We believe in progress made together—and that’s exactly how we want to build: side by side with you.
